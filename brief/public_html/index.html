        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>EasyDesign is a new startup company launching a service to enable
          customers such as charities and organisations to quickly produce well
          designed logos, posters and flyers based on user generated content.</p>

        <p>The site will make money by taking a cut from sales of  paid content,
          and through advertising.</p>
        
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>User stories</h2>
        <h3>1. Upload content</h3>
        <p>Content creators upload their created design templates to the site. They can
          then use the online editor to
          add placeholders over the top of their design where other users can
          add customised text. For example, an event poster template may have
          placeholders for the name, description, location and contact details.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Browsing content</h3>
        <p>Customers can search and browse the site to discover the content
          they are looking for. They can search by content type (e.g. logos, posters, flyers),
          by creator name or by search term.</p>
        <p>They can also visit the "What's hot" page to view designs with a high 
          number of downloads and ratings.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Downloading content</h3>
        <p>When a customer finds a design they like, they can add content to the
          design placeholders and download a high quality version of the
          design to print/upload to their website.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Reviewing content</h3>
        <p>When a customer has downloaded a design, they gain permission to rate
          and comment on it.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Uploading paid content</h3>
        <p>If a creator's content receives good reviews and a set number of downloads,
          they become legible to upload paid content. </p>
